ECLIPSE ANDROID PROJECT IMPORT SUMMARY
======================================

Ignored Files:
--------------
The following files were *not* copied into the new Gradle project; you
should evaluate whether these are still needed in your project and if
so manually move them:

* .DS_Store
* Folliet2016.apk
* brother/
* brother/.DS_Store
* copcol
* ic_launcher-web.png
* keytool
* negos-release-key.keystore
* proguard-project.txt
* proguard/
* proguard/dump.txt
* proguard/mapping.txt
* proguard/seeds.txt
* proguard/usage.txt

Moved Files:
------------
Android Gradle projects use a different directory structure than ADT
Eclipse projects. Here's how the projects were restructured:

* AndroidManifest.xml => app/src/main/AndroidManifest.xml
* assets/ => app/src/main/assets/
* libs/MobilePrintLib.jar => app/libs/MobilePrintLib.jar
* libs/date4j.jar => app/libs/date4j.jar
* libs/ksoap2-android-assembly-2.6.4-jar-with-dependencies.jar => app/libs/ksoap2-android-assembly-2.6.4-jar-with-dependencies.jar
* lint.xml => app/lint.xml
* proguard.cfg => app/proguard.cfg
* res/ => app/src/main/res/
* src/ => app/src/main/java/

Next Steps:
-----------
You can now build the project. The Gradle project needs network
connectivity to download dependencies.

Bugs:
-----
If for some reason your project does not build, and you determine that
it is due to a bug or limitation of the Eclipse to Gradle importer,
please file a bug at http://b.android.com with category
Component-Tools.

after import once you are satisfied with the results.)
